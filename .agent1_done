# Agent 1 (Requirements Owner) - Session Summary

## Session Date/Time
2026-02-14T14:03:34.458Z

## Phase
PLANNING

**Rationale for remaining in PLANNING phase:**
- 8 requirements remain UNVERIFIED (8 ASSIGNED, 8 DESIGNED, 1 OPEN)
- Only 8 of 30 requirements are VERIFIED (26.7%)
- Convergence phase requires all requirements to be either VERIFIED or CLOSED

## Session Summary
Completed findings disposition for VER-001 and VER-002, processed VER-003 verification results (PASS with no findings), updated traceability matrix, created 5 new design tasks for 13 previously OPEN requirements, and updated requirement statuses. All findings have been dispositioned as ACCEPTED.

## Key Actions Taken

1. **Findings Disposition:**
   - VER-001-Isp-Discrepancy: ACCEPTED - Both Isp values exceed requirement with substantial margin
   - VER-002-Conservative-Margin-Fail: ACCEPTED - Nominal case has 82.8% margin; conservative case represents extreme worst-case
   - Documented rationale in DEC-011 and DEC-012 (DECISIONS.md)

2. **Verification Processing:**
   - Reviewed VER-003 catalyst preheat verification: PASS (no findings)
   - Updated TRACE_MATRIX.md with VER-003 evidence
   - REQ-014 and REQ-027 marked as VERIFIED

3. **Design Task Assignment:**
   - Created 5 new design tasks (DES-006 through DES-010) covering 13 requirements
   - DES-006: Pulse Modulation & Valve Control (REQ-003, REQ-004)
   - DES-007: Propellant Isolation & Safety Systems (REQ-006, REQ-007)
   - DES-008: Electrical Interface & Control (REQ-009, REQ-010, REQ-019)
   - DES-009: Mechanical Interfaces & Fastening (REQ-017, REQ-022)
   - DES-010: Manufacturing & Quality (REQ-025, REQ-028, REQ-029, REQ-030)

4. **Requirement Status Updates:**
   - Updated REQ_REGISTER.md: 13 requirements changed from OPEN to ASSIGNED
   - All findings marked as dispositioned in FINDINGS.md

## Current Project Status

| Status | Count | Requirements |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| **VERIFIED** | 8 | REQ-001, REQ-002, REQ-005, REQ-008, REQ-014, REQ-020, REQ-021, REQ-027 |
| **ASSIGNED** | 8 | REQ-003, REQ-004, REQ-006, REQ-007, REQ-009, REQ-010, REQ-017, REQ-019, REQ-022, REQ-025, REQ-028, REQ-029, REQ-030 |
| **DESIGNED** | 8 | REQ-011, REQ-012, REQ-013, REQ-015, REQ-016, REQ-018, REQ-023, REQ-024, REQ-026 |
| **OPEN** | 1 | REQ-016 (needs clarification/design) |
| **CLOSED** | 5 | REQ-xxx (5 requirements closed/archived) |
| **TOTAL** | **30** | |

## Pending Work

### Agent 2 (Design Engineer)
- DES-006: Pulse Modulation & Valve Control (2 requirements)
- DES-007: Propellant Isolation & Safety Systems (2 requirements)
- DES-008: Electrical Interface & Control (3 requirements)
- DES-009: Mechanical Interfaces & Fastening (2 requirements)
- DES-010: Manufacturing & Quality (4 requirements)

### Agent 3 (Verification Engineer)
- VER-004: Thrust/Isp verification (awaiting design completion)
- VER-005: Propellant budget verification (awaiting design completion)

## Outstanding Findings
**None** - All findings have been dispositioned as ACCEPTED.

## Next Session Priorities

1. Monitor VER-004 and VER-005 verification progress (awaiting design completion from Agent 2)
2. Process any new findings from pending verification tasks
3. Assign verification tasks for DES-006 through DES-010 once design work is complete
4. Continue updating TRACE_MATRIX.md and REQ_REGISTER.md as requirements transition through lifecycle
5. Assess readiness for CONVERGENCE phase once VERIFIED requirement count reaches 23 or more
