          10 + ## Executive Summary

          11 +

          1+ This report documents the completion of Sprint 1 for the

             Requirements-Based Engineering (RBE) Multi-Agent System

             satellite monopropellant thruster design project. Since the

             previous narrative, the project has progressed from partial

             completion (50% design, 30% verification) to full sprint

             completion (100% design, 100% verification). No new git commits

             were made during this period; all progress consists of

             uncommitted working directory modifications that represent the

             complete final deliverables for Sprint 1.

          13 +

          14 + **Key Achievements:**

          15 + - **10 Design Tasks Completed** (100% of total design work)

          16+- **12 Verification Tasks          (100% of scheduled

               Completed**                     verification)

          17 + - **17 Design Decisions** documented and dispositioned

         +- **6 Verification   raised and fully dispositioned (2 ACCEPTED, 2

   18       Findings**        CLOSED, 1 WAIVED, 1 N/A)

          26 +

          27 + ### Phase 10: Thrust Control System Design (DES-006)

          28 + **Status:** COMPLETED (uncommitted)

          29 +

          30+Agent 2 completed the thrust control system design addressing

             thrust range, impulse bit accuracy, and startup transient

             performance:

          32 + **Design Deliverables:**

          33+- `design/scripts/thrust_control. - Thrust control analysis

               y`                             script

          34+ - `design/data/thrust_control.json - Control system output data



          3+ - `design/docs/thrust_control_system - Thrust control

               md`                               documentation

          3+- `design/plots/DES006_startup_transi - Startup transient

              nt.png`                            visualization

          3+- `design/plots/DES006_thrust_vs_pres - Thrust vs pressure

              ure.png`                           relationship

          38 +

          39 + **Key Design Results:**

          4+ - Achievable thrust range: 0.8 N to 1.0 N within feed pressure

              constraint (0.15-0.30 MPa)

          41+ - Minimum impulse bit: 0.008 N·s (20% margin vs. 0.01 N

               requirement)

          4+ - Startup transient time to 90% thrust: 87 ms (56.5% margin vs.

              200 ms requirement)

          4+ - Upper thrust bound (1.2 N) requires 0.36 MPa feed pressure,

              exceeding REQ-009 limit

          44 +

          45 + **Design Decision Made (DEC-013):**

          4+ - DEC-013: Thrust control range limited to 0.8-1.0 N (25%

              control authority) due to feed pressure constraint. Upper bound

               (1.2 N) conflicts with REQ-009 (0.30 MPa maximum). 25% control

               authority deemed sufficient for attitude control operations.



          47 +

          48 + **Requirements Compliance:**

          4+ - REQ-003: PARTIAL (0.8-1.0 N achievable, 1.2 N requires

              exceeding feed pressure limit)

          50 + - REQ-004: PASS (0.008 N·s ≤ 0.01 N requirement)
