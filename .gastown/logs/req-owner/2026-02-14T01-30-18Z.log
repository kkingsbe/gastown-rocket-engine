 ✓ Task Completed



   ## BOOTSTRAP Phase Complete



   Successfully completed the BOOTSTRAP phase for Agent 1 — Requirements Owner.

    The multi-agent requirements engineering workflow is now fully initialized

   and ready for the PLANNING phase.



   ### Summary of Accomplishments



   #### 1. Requirements Decomposition



   Created REQ_REGISTER.md with 30 atomic, verifiable requirements decomposed

   from the user's REQUIREMENTS.md:



       * Performance (6): Thrust, Isp, thrust range, impulse bit, total

   impulse, startup time

       * Propellant (4): Hydrazine usage, mass budget, feed pressure range,

   temperature range

       * Physical (3): Dry mass, envelope dimensions, mounting interface

       * Thermal (4): Catalyst preheat, chamber wall limit, nozzle exit limit,

   thermal cycle survival

       * Structural (2): Chamber pressure withstand, nozzle thermal stress

       * Lifetime (3): Firing cycles, catalyst life, leak-before-burst design

       * Material Constraints (3): Chamber compatibility, nozzle material,

   space-qualified materials

       * Interface (4): Propellant inlet, electrical heater, pressure

   transducer, temperature sensors

       * Mission (1): 15-year mission life



   #### 2. Traceability Matrix



   Created TRACE_MATRIX.md tracking all 30 requirements with:



       * REQ ID, requirement text (short), design artifact, verification

   evidence, and status columns

       * All requirements currently in OPEN status awaiting design and

   verification work



   #### 3. Work Queues



       * TODO_DESIGN.md: 5 initial design tasks assigned to Agent 2 (Design &

   Implementation)

       * TODO_VERIFY.md: 5 initial verification tasks assigned to Agent 3

   (Verification & Validation)



   Initial work assignments cover 14 foundational requirements that enable

   subsequent work across performance, propellant, thermal, physical,

   structural, material, and interface domains.



   #### 4. Decision Log



   Created DECISIONS.md template for logging all architectural and trade

   decisions with clear rationale and requirement traceability.



   #### 5. Communication Infrastructure



   Created cross-agent communication directories:



       * comms/inbox/ - For Agent 1 to receive RFIs, status updates, and

   findings

       * comms/outbox/ - For Agent 1 to send responses and approvals



   Both directories include comprehensive README documentation with message

   format specifications.



   #### 6. Completion Signals



   Created .agent1_done marker signaling Agent 1's BOOTSTRAP phase completion.



   #### 7. Git Commit



   Committed all changes with commit hash bd7f489:



       * Commit message: req(req-owner): Bootstrap phase - complete

   requirements decomposition and workflow setup

       * 8 files committed (918 insertions)



   ### Workflow Status



   Phase: BOOTSTRAP ✅ COMPLETE



   Next Steps:



       1. Agent 2 (Design & Implementation) will process the 5 initial design

   tasks in TODO_DESIGN.md

       2. Agent 3 (Verification & Validation) will process verification tasks

   in TODO_VERIFY.md as design artifacts become available

       3. Agent 1 will transition to PLANNING phase on next invocation,

   monitoring progress and assigning new work as needed

       4. All three agents will eventually reach CONVERGENCE phase when all

   requirements are verified



   The multi-agent workflow is now fully operational with complete traceability

    from user requirements through design to verification.
