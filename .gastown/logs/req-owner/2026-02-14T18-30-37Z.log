 │ Actually, let me reconsider. The user has provided me with a task          │

 │ specification for "Agent 1 - Requirements Owner". This is describing a     │

 │                                                                            │

 │ But wait - the user message just says <task> followed by the               │

 │ AGENT_1_REQUIREMENTS_OWNER.md specification. This is describing what Agent │

 │  1 should do.                                                              │

  I can see from the environment details that this is a three-agent system that

  has completed a sprint (all .agent*_done files and .sprint_complete exist). The

   task specification describes "Agent 1 — Requirements Owner" which should

  coordinate requirements decomposition and traceability.



  However, I cannot read files directly in orchestrator mode. Let me delegate the

   analysis to "ask" mode to understand the current state:





[2K[1A[2K[G > Analyze the current state of this three-agent system that has completed a

   sprint.



   Please read and summarize the following files to understand what has been

   accomplished:



       1. REQ_REGISTER.md - requirements register status

       2. TRACE_MATRIX.md - traceability matrix showing requirement coverage

       3. TODO_DESIGN.md - design work queue status

       4. TODO_VERIFY.md - verification work queue status

       5. REQUIREMENTS.md - original user requirements

       6. .sprint_complete - sprint completion summary if it has content

       7. AGENTS3_SPECIFICATION_COMPLIANCE_REPORT.md - compliance report

       8. DECISIONS.md - architectural decisions made

       9. FINDINGS.md - any findings logged



   Provide a comprehensive summary of:



       * How many requirements were defined and their current status

       * What design artifacts were created

       * What verification work was completed

       * Any outstanding issues or findings

       * Whether all requirements have been traced and verified



   This will help me determine if this is a post-sprint review phase, a new

   sprint setup, or if there's remediation work needed.
