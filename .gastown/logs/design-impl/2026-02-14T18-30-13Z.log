  I can see you've shared the Agent 2 Design & Implementation Engineer

  specification document. This appears to be a comprehensive workflow guide for a

   design engineering agent in a multi-agent system.



  Looking at the workspace, I can see this is an active project with all three

  agent markers (.agent1_done, .agent2_done, .agent3_done) and a .sprint_complete

   file, indicating the system has already completed a full cycle.



  What would you like me to help you with regarding this specification?



  Some options:



      1. Review and analyze the Agent 2 specification and provide feedback on its

   design

      2. Create a new task using this Agent 2 specification to work on a new

  engineering design project

      3. Set up a new multi-agent workflow based on this three-agent system

  (Requirements Owner, Design Engineer, Verification Engineer)

      4. Generate documentation explaining how this multi-agent system works

      5. Something else - please let me know your specific goal



  Please clarify what you'd like to accomplish so I can delegate the appropriate

  work to the right specialized modes.
