 ✓ Task Completed



   I've analyzed the Agent 2 Design & Implementation Engineer specification you

    provided. The project workspace shows a completed multi-agent rocket

   thruster design system with all agents finished and design/verification

   artifacts in place.



   To proceed effectively, please clarify your goal by selecting one of these

   options:



   a) Audit/review the completed Agent 2 work against the specification

   b) Explain how the Agent 2 role and workflow operates

   c) Extract key principles from the specification for reuse in other projects

   d) Modify or improve the specification itself

   e) Describe a different objective



   Once you provide your selection, I'll proceed with the appropriate workflow.
