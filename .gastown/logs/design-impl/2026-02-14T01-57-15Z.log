  Excellent progress! Two Agent 2 tasks have been completed successfully. Let me

  continue with the next design task:





[2K[1A[2K[G  # Continue Agent 2 — Design & Implementation Engineer (DES-003)



  ## Progress Update



  Completed tasks:



      * ✅ DES-001: Thruster Performance Sizing

      * ✅ DES-002: Propellant Budget Calculation



  Remaining tasks from TODO_DESIGN.md:



      * DES-003: Catalyst Preheat System Design

      * DES-004: Chamber and Nozzle Structural Sizing

      * DES-005: Physical Envelope and Mechanical Interface Design



  ## Your Task



  Process the next unchecked item from TODO_DESIGN.md (DES-003: Catalyst Preheat

  System Design).



  Follow the Agent 2 workflow specification:



      1. Check comms/inbox/ — Look for new messages from Agent 1

      2. Read TODO_DESIGN.md — Find DES-003 and understand the scope and

  acceptance criteria

      3. Read traced requirements from REQ_REGISTER.md — Understand exactly what

  "done" looks like

      4. Read CONTEXT.md — Use domain equations and reference data provided

      5. Produce design artifacts following the Design Protocol:

          6. Requirements Review checklist

          7. Design Space Exploration (if non-trivial)

          8. Produce Artifact (document + script + data + plots if quantitative)

          9. Generate Design Visualizations

          10. Self-check against acceptance criteria

      11. Run scripts and verify output

      12. Mark DES-003 complete in TODO_DESIGN.md

      13. Log any new decisions in DECISIONS.md

      14. Commit changes with convention: des(design): <description>

      15. Use attempt_completion to provide summary



  ## Important Notes



      * Complete ONE task per invocation, then stop

      * Follow all rules from AGENT_2_DESIGN_IMPLEMENTATION.md

      * Verify scripts run without error before committing

      * Document all constants and assumptions with sources

      * If a requirement is quantitative, you MUST produce executable Python code



  Proceed with DES-003: Catalyst Preheat System Design now.
