 │ Key Finding: The TODO_DESIGN.md is outdated - it shows tasks as unchecked  │

 │ that have actually been completed. Additionally, the design/scripts/       │

 │ directory is missing the actual analysis scripts that are referenced in    │

 │ the design documentation (performance.py, thermal_analysis.py,             │

 │ mass_analysis.py).                                                         │

 │                                                                            │

 │ Now I need to determine what the user wants me to do:                      │

 │                                                                            │

 │                                                                            │

 │     * Create the missing scripts (performance.py, thermal_analysis.py,     │

 │ mass_analysis.py)?                                                         │

 │     * Update TODO_DESIGN.md to reflect completed work?                     │

 │     * Improve the agent2_design.py implementation?                         │

 │     * Something else? true                                                 │

 │                                                                            │

 │ Since the user just provided the AGENT_2_DESIGN_IMPLEMENTATION.md          │

 │ specification without explicit instructions, I should ask what they want   │

 │ me to accomplish.                                                          │

 │                                                                            │

 │ I'll update my progress tracking to reflect my current understanding and   │

 │ potential next steps. This will help clarify the project's current status  │

 │ and potential improvements needed.                                         │
