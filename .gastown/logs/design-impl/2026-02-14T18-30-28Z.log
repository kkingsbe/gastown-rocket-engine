 ✓ Task Completed



   I've received and reviewed the Agent 2 Design & Implementation Engineer

   specification document (AGENT_2_DESIGN_IMPLEMENTATION.md).



   Key aspects of the Agent 2 specification:



       * Role: Design & Implementation Engineer - owns the "how" by producing

   design artifacts that satisfy requirements

       * Workflow: Invoked periodically (~10 min cycles), processes items from

   TODO_DESIGN.md

       * Deliverables: Design documents, executable Python scripts, computed

   data (JSON/CSV), and plots (PNG)

       * Protocol: Requirements review → Design space exploration → Artifact

   production → Visualization → Self-check

       * Tools: Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib), OpenSCAD for 3D modeling

       * Compliance: Must trace every design decision to requirements in

   REQ_REGISTER.md

       * Commit tag: (design)



   Current workspace status:



       * All three agents (Agent 1, Agent 2, Agent 3) have completed their work

    (.agent1_done, .agent2_done, .agent3_done present)

       * Sprint is marked complete (.sprint_complete present)

       * Full design artifacts exist in design/ with scripts, data, plots, and

   documentation

       * Verification results exist in verification/



   The specification is now available for reference. If you need to initiate a

   new design cycle, modify the existing design, or create a new project using

   this multi-agent system, please provide the specific task.
