 > Could you please clarify what you'd like me to do with the Agent 3 specification? Here are some options:



       1. Review and analyze - Provide feedback on the specification's completeness, clarity, or potential

   improvements

       2. Implement/activate - Set up Agent 3 to begin verification work according to this specification

       3. Document - Create a summary or executive report about this specification

       4. Use as reference - Keep this in mind for future verification tasks

       5. Something else - Let me know your specific intent



   Since the workspace already shows verification work has been completed (VER-001 through VER-012 reports

   exist, and .agent3_done is present), I want to ensure I understand your goal before proceeding.
