 ✓ Task Completed



   I've reviewed the Agent 3 — Verification & Validation Engineer specification

    you provided. This is a comprehensive specification document defining:



   Agent 3's Role:



       * Periodic independent verification of design artifacts against

   requirements

       * Quality gate that produces independent simulations and verification

   plots

       * Owns the "proof" that designs meet requirements



   Key Workflows:



       * Phase detection: WAITING → VERIFICATION → COMPLETE

       * Four verification methods: INSPECTION, ANALYSIS, SIMULATION,

   DEMONSTRATION

       * Independence requirement: Must write code from scratch, not reuse

   Agent 2's scripts

       * Every quantitative verification requires plots showing requirement

   thresholds



   Current Workspace Status:

   The Agent 3 system is fully operational with completed work:



       * 12 verification reports (VER-001 through VER-012) in

   verification/reports/

       * Corresponding scripts in verification/scripts/

       * Data and plots in verification/data/ and verification/plots/

       * Verification summary report in verification/SUMMARY.md

       * Communications with Agent 1 in comms/outbox/

       * .agent3_done and .sprint_complete markers present



   The specification is properly implemented and all verification tasks have

   been completed for this sprint.
