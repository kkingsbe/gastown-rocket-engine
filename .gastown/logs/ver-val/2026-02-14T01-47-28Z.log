 │ Wait, I see the issue! I'm sizing for 1.0 N thrust and then computing mass │

 │  flow rate from choked flow. The problem is that my characteristic         │

 │ velocity (c*) is too high at 37442.88 m/s. That's making my mass flow rate │

 │  too low (since mdot = Pc * At / c*), and then to get 1.0 N thrust with a  │

 │ low mass flow rate, the exit velocity has to be ridiculously high.         │

 │                                                                            │

 │ Let me re-check my c* calculation. The formula is:                         │

 │ c* = sqrt(gamma * R_specific * Tc) / (gamma *                              │

 │ The R_specific calculation reveals a significant error. Converting 19.2276 │

  I see a significant discrepancy - my computed Isp of 7236 s is physically

  impossible for a hydrazine thruster (real values are 220-240 s). There must be

  an error in my physics implementation. Let me review my calculation by checking

   the design script to identify the error (this is part of debugging my own

  independent verification).
