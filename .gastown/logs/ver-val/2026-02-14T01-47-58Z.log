 │ Agent 2 uses a NOZZLE_EFFICIENCY of 0.035 to account for real-world        │

 │ My independent simulation did NOT apply this efficiency factor - I         │

 │ Wait, looking more carefully at Agent 2's code at line 76:                 │

 │                                                                            │

 │ But I see in my simulation I used 0.25 MPa. However, looking at my         │

 │ results, both give 1.0 N thrust because I sized the throat for exactly 1.0 │

 │  N thrust.                                                                 │

 │ I discovered a critical discrepancy in the design data. The feed pressure  │

 │ in the JSON file differs from the code configuration, creating a           │

 │ significant mismatch in thrust calculations. This explains why the         │

 │ performance results diverge between simulations. The throat sizing         │

 │ introduces a fundamental variation in the computational model.             │

 │                                                                            │

 │ The nozzle efficiency emerges as the pivotal factor in understanding the   │

 │ complex real-world losses not modeled in idealized simulations, revealing  │

 │ a nuanced approach to thruster design that accounts for practical          │

 │ limitations.                                                               │

 │ The nozzle efficiency fundamentally transforms the performance             │

 │ calculation, reducing thrust from 1.71 N to 1.0 N through critical design  │

 │ constraints.                                                               │

 │ Agent 2's approach requires deeper investigation, particularly regarding   │

 │ the selection of 0.30 MPa as the feed pressure and its implications for    │

 │ overall thruster design. The nuanced method of sizing the throat with      │

 │ efficiency integrated suggests a more sophisticated engineering strategy   │

 │ My independent simulation reveals a 1664% discrepancy in Isp calculations, │

 │  primarily driven by fundamental differences in efficiency modeling and    │

 │ feed pressure selection. These computational variations underscore the     │

 │ importance of rigorous cross-validation in propulsion system analysis.     │

 │                                                                            │

 │ The throat sizing methodologies diverge significantly, with Agent 2        │

 │ incorporating efficiency directly into the design process while I          │

 │ approached sizing without real-world constraints. This methodological      │

 │ The thrust calculation method appears critical - I need to carefully       │

 │                                                                            │

  I found the source of the discrepancy. My independent simulation used ideal

  isentropic equations (theoretical maximum Isp ~7236 s), while Agent 2 correctly

   applied a nozzle efficiency factor of 0.035 to account for real-world losses.

  This explains the 1664% delta in Isp.



  However, I also noticed another critical issue: my verification shows thrust =

  1.0 N (PASS), but Agent 2's computed thrust is 1.711 N (FAIL for REQ-001). Let

  me verify by re-running Agent 2's script to confirm their results and

  understand the discrepancy.
