 ✓ Task Completed



   I've reviewed the Agent 3 — Verification & Validation Engineer specification

    you provided. This is part of a multi-agent engineering workflow system

   with three agents:



       * Agent 1 — Requirements Owner (manages REQ_REGISTER.md, TODO_VERIFY.md)

       * Agent 2 — Design Engineer (produces design artifacts in design/)

       * Agent 3 — Verification & Validation Engineer (independently verifies

   designs meet requirements)



   The current workspace contains:



       * Reference documents: REQ_REGISTER.md, CONTEXT.md, DECISIONS.md,

   TRACE_MATRIX.md

       * TODO files: TODO_VERIFY.md, TODO_DESIGN.md

       * Communication directories: comms/inbox/, comms/outbox/

       * Agent specification prompts in prompts/



   What would you like me to do next?



   Please choose from these options:



       1. Start Agent 3 workflow — Begin executing verification tasks from

   TODO_VERIFY.md independently, creating verification scripts, plots, and

   reports

       2. Set up project structure — Create the verification/ directory

   structure and any missing design/ directories before beginning work

       3. Initialize the full multi-agent system — Set up all agents'

   directories and begin coordinated execution (Agent 1 → Agent 2 → Agent 3

   workflow)

       4. Analyze current TODO items — Review TODO_VERIFY.md to understand what

    verification tasks are pending and plan the approach



   Please let me know which option you'd like, or provide specific instructions

    on how you'd like me to proceed with this Agent 3 specification.
