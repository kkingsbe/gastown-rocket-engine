 > I can see you've provided a comprehensive specification for Agent 3 —

   Verification & Validation Engineer. The workspace shows this agent system is

   already in place with verification work completed (VER-001 through VER-012).



   To help you effectively, could you clarify what you'd like me to do with this

   specification? Here are some possibilities:
