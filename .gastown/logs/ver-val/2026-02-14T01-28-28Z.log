  I can see you have a multi-agent engineering workflow system with Agent 3 —

  Verification & Validation Engineer specified. The workspace contains the

  necessary reference documents (REQ_REGISTER.md, CONTEXT.md, DECISIONS.md,

  TRACE_MATRIX.md) and TODO files (TODO_VERIFY.md, TODO_DESIGN.md).



  To proceed effectively, I need to understand your goal. Could you clarify what

  you'd like me to do with this Agent 3 specification?
