 │     * Verification protocol with 4 methods (INSPECTION, ANALYSIS,          │

 │ SIMULATION, DEMONSTRATION)                                                 │

 │ Looking at the workspace, I can see:                                       │

 │                                                                            │

 │                                                                            │

 │     * .agent1_done exists (Agent 1 completed)                              │

 │     * Various design files from Agent 2 exist                              │

 │     * There's already some verification work done (VER-001 files exist)    │

 │     * TODO_VERIFY.md exists and may have more items                        │

 │     * FINDINGS.md exists false                                             │

 │                                                                            │

 │ The user appears to be providing me with the specification for Agent 3,    │

 │ which suggests I need to execute as Agent 3 and perform verification and   │

 │ validation work according to this protocol.                                │

 │                                                                            │

 │ However, I'm currently in "Orchestrator" mode, not "Verification" mode.    │

 │ The Orchestrator mode is for coordinating complex workflows and delegating │

 │  tasks to specialized modes.                                               │

 │                                                                            │

 │ Let me analyze what's needed:                                              │

 │                                                                            │

 │                                                                            │

 │     * I need to check if TODO_VERIFY.md has unchecked items                │

 │     * If so, I should perform verification work according to the protocol  │

 │     * The protocol involves reading files, writing simulation scripts,     │

 │ generating plots, etc. true                                                │

 │                                                                            │

 │ Since this appears to be a comprehensive agent specification that I need   │

 │ to execute, and the workspace shows Agent 1 is done (.agent1_done exists), │

 │  I should:                                                                 │

 │                                                                            │

 │                                                                            │

 │     * First, read TODO_VERIFY.md to see if there's work to do              │

 │     * Check the current state of verification work                         │

 │     * Either execute the verification work directly or delegate to an      │

 │ appropriate mode true                                                      │

 │                                                                            │

 │ Actually, looking more carefully at my mode instructions - I'm the         │

 │ "Orchestrator" mode which is for coordinating complex workflows by         │

 │ delegating to specialized modes. The user has provided me with the Agent 3 │

 │  specification, which means they want me to execute this verification      │

 │ work.                                                                      │

 │                                                                            │

 │ I'll carefully examine the TODO_VERIFY.md to understand the specific       │

 │ verification requirements. The presence of existing verification work      │

 │ suggests I'll need to review what's already been completed and identify    │

 │ remaining tasks. My Orchestrator role means I'll likely need to coordinate │

 │  and potentially delegate specific verification steps to appropriate       │

 │ specialized modes if the task becomes complex.                             │

 │                                                                            │

 │ The current workspace state indicates multiple verification-related files, │

 │  which means Agent 3 has been actively working on verification tasks. I'll │

 │  start by checking the TODO list and understanding the current project     │

 │ verification status.                                                       │

 > I'll help you execute the Agent 3 Verification & Validation workflow. Let me

   first examine the current state of the verification work to understand what

   needs to be done.
