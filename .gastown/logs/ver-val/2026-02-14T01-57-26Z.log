 │ I see - I'm in Orchestrator mode and I cannot use the read_file tool       │

 │ directly. The Orchestrator mode is designed to delegate tasks to           │

 │ specialized modes. Since this is a comprehensive verification and          │

 │ validation task that requires reading files, executing scripts, and        │

 │ generating plots, I should delegate this to an appropriate mode.           │

 │                                                                            │

 │ This sounds like it could be done in Code mode (for writing and executing  │

 │ scripts) or perhaps a specialized verification mode if it exists.          │

 │                                                                            │

 │ Let me check what modes are available by looking at the context. Based on  │

 │                                                                            │

 │     * Architect mode - for planning, design, or strategizing               │

 │     * Code mode - for writing, modifying, or refactoring code              │

 │     * Ask mode - for explanations, documentation                           │

 │     * Debug mode - for troubleshooting issues                              │

 │     * Orchestrator mode - for coordinating complex workflows false         │

 │                                                                            │

 │ Given that Agent 3 requires writing independent simulation scripts,        │

 │ executing them, generating plots, and performing computational             │

 │ verification, the most appropriate mode would be Code mode.                │

 │                                                                            │

 │ However, I should first check if there's a more specific task or if the    │

 │ user wants me to act as Agent 3 directly. The task description provided is │

 │  very detailed and specific - it's essentially the complete protocol for   │

 │ Agent 3.                                                                   │

 │                                                                            │

 │ Let me think about this differently. The user has provided me with the     │

 │ AGENT_3_VERIFICATION_VALIDATION.md specification, which describes what     │

 │ Agent 3 does. But they haven't explicitly asked me to execute as Agent 3 - │

 │  they've just provided the specification document.                         │

 │                                                                            │

 │ Given that I'm in Orchestrator mode and the specification describes a      │

 │ complete agent workflow, I should probably ask the user for clarification  │

 │ about what they want me to do:                                             │

 │                                                                            │

 │                                                                            │

 │     * Do they want me to EXECUTE as Agent 3 and perform the verification   │

 │ work?                                                                      │

 │     * Do they want me to CREATE a new mode for Agent 3?                    │

  I understand you've provided the Agent 3 Verification & Validation

  specification. I can see from the workspace that Agent 3 has already completed

  VER-001 (thrust and Isp verification), and there are verification artifacts

  present in the workspace.



  As an Orchestrator, I should delegate this verification work to the appropriate

   specialized mode. The Agent 3 protocol requires writing independent simulation

   scripts, executing computational analysis, and generating verification plots -

   this work is best performed by Code mode.



  Let me delegate the Agent 3 verification workflow to Code mode:





[2K[1A[2K[G  You are executing as Agent 3 — Verification & Validation Engineer. Follow the

  AGENT_3_VERIFICATION_VALIDATION.md protocol to perform independent verification

   of design artifacts.



  ## Context



      * Agent 1 (.agent1_done) has completed requirements specification

      * Agent 2 has created design artifacts in design/

      * VER-001 (thrust/Isp verification) has already been completed



  ## Your Task



  Execute one iteration of the Agent 3 verification protocol:



      1. Check TODO_VERIFY.md to identify the next unchecked, unblocked

  verification item

      2. Check comms/inbox/ for messages from Agent 1

      3. Read the traced requirements from REQ_REGISTER.md

      4. Read CONTEXT.md for domain equations and reference data

      5. Read Agent 2's design DATA (not code) from design/data/

      6. Write an independent simulation script in verification/scripts/

  following the template:

          * Implement physics independently from first principles

          7. Do NOT copy Agent 2's code logic

          8. Read only their design parameters/data

      9. Execute the script to generate results and plots

      10. Write a verification report in verification/reports/

      11. Log the finding in FINDINGS.md with all numerical data

      12. If FAIL: Notify Agent 1 via comms/outbox/

      13. Mark the item complete in TODO_VERIFY.md

      14. COMMIT with tag: ver(verify): <description>

      15. STOP after completing one item



  ## Critical Requirements



      * Independence is non-negotiable — write your own simulation code from

  physics

      * Every verification MUST have a plot showing requirement threshold line,

  Agent 2 design point, and Agent 3 computed point

      * Plots MUST go to verification/plots/ as PNG at 150 DPI

      * Generate at least one plot per verification

      * Be precise — report actual numerical values and percentages



  ## Workspace State



  You have these files available:



      * TODO_VERIFY.md (check boxes for verification items)

      * REQ_REGISTER.md (authoritative requirements)

      * CONTEXT.md (domain reference)

      * design/data/*.json (Agent 2's design data)

      * design/scripts/*.py (read only for understanding, not for copying)

      * verification/ (your output directories)



  ## Your Output



  Complete one full verification cycle and report back with:



      * Which verification item you processed (VER-XXX)

      * The verdict (PASS/FAIL/CONDITIONAL)

      * Key numerical results

      * Any plots generated



  This is a single-iteration task. Complete one verification item, commit, and

  stop.
