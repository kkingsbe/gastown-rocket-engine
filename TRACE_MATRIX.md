# TRACE_MATRIX.md — Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Purpose

This document provides traceability from requirements to design artifacts and verification evidence. It tracks the status of each requirement (REQ-001 through REQ-030) throughout the project lifecycle, ensuring that all requirements are properly addressed in design and verified through appropriate evidence.

The traceability matrix follows the flow:
- **Requirement → Design Artifact → Verification Evidence**

## Status Definitions

- **OPEN**: Requirement has been defined but not yet assigned to design or verification activities
- **ASSIGNED**: Requirement has been assigned to a design artifact
- **VERIFIED**: Requirement has been verified through simulation, analysis, inspection, or demonstration
- **CLOSED**: Requirement is complete with design artifact and verification evidence documented

## Traceability Notes

This matrix will be updated throughout the project lifecycle to track:
- Assignment of design artifacts to each requirement
- Verification evidence generation and results
- Requirement status progression from OPEN to CLOSED
- Any changes or additions to the requirements baseline
