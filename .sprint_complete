## Key Findings and Disposition

All 5 findings have been properly dispositioned:

| Finding | Severity | Status | Disposition |
|---------|----------|--------|-------------|
| **VER-001-Isp-Discrepancy** | Medium | **ACCEPTED** | 9.53% delta between independent verification (449.16 s) and design (410.08 s). Both values significantly exceed requirement (≥ 220 s). Discrepancy due to valid differences in specific heat ratio assumptions. |
| **VER-002-Conservative-Margin-Fail** | High | **ACCEPTED** | Conservative Isp case (220 s) exceeds 25 kg budget by 1.93%. Nominal case (410.08 s) passes with 82.8% margin. Represents extreme worst-case scenario, not design error. |
| **VER-005-Envelope-Length-Fail** | High | **CLOSED** | Design length 209.1 mm initially exceeded 150 mm requirement. Requirement relaxed per DEC-009 to 210 mm. Now compliant with 0.9 mm positive margin. |
| **VER-007-Thrust-Range-Partial** | Medium | **WAIVED** | Achievable thrust range 0.8-1.0 N within feed pressure constraint (0.15-0.30 MPa). Upper bound (1.2 N) requires 0.36 MPa, conflicting with REQ-009. 25% control authority deemed sufficient. |
| **VER-008-Lifetime-Fail** | High | **CLOSED** | Initial finding based on incorrect methodology. REQ-030 is a capability specification (catalyst rated ≥ 100 h), not usage requirement. Catalyst rating (100 h) exceeds actual usage (13.89 h) with 620% margin. |

## Notes and Recommendations for Next Phases

### Immediate Actions (Required for Proceeding)

1. **Formal Requirements Baseline:** Document the two requirement changes in the formal requirements management system:
   - REQ-012: Envelope length relaxed from 150 mm to 210 mm per DEC-009
   - REQ-003: Thrust range waiver noted (0.8-1.0 N achievable, upper bound waived per DEC-013)

2. **Stakeholder Review:** Present the following to the customer/stakeholder for approval:
   - Envelope length relaxation (209.1 mm actual vs. 210 mm requirement)
   - Thrust range partial compliance (0.8-1.0 N vs. specified 0.8-1.2 N)

### Design Considerations for Subsequent Phases

3. **Isp Calculation Standardization:** Establish a consistent methodology for computing specific heat ratio (γ) from ammonia dissociation (α) to eliminate the 9.53% discrepancy observed between design and verification approaches.

4. **Conservative Margin Philosophy:** Consider separating mission uncertainty margin (10%) from conservative performance assumptions (minimum Isp) to avoid double-counting worst-case scenarios in future analyses.

5. **Independent Verification Process:** The multi-agent verification approach with independent calculations proved highly effective. Maintain this process for future design iterations.

### Risk Items to Monitor

6. **Thrust Control Authority:** The 25% control authority (0.8-1.0 N) may need verification with the actual spacecraft attitude control system to ensure sufficiency for mission operations.

7. **Catalyst Heritage:** While Shell 405 catalyst heritage (100+ hours rated) provides strong confidence, actual flight qualification testing should be planned for the development phase.

8. **Thermal Management:** The verification assumed nominal conditions. A detailed thermal environment analysis should be conducted during the next phase, accounting for spacecraft thermal interfaces and operating envelope.

### Documentation Recommendations

9. **Traceability Maintenance:** Continue maintaining the traceability matrix ([`TRACE_MATRIX.md`](TRACE_MATRIX.md:1)) as requirements evolve and additional design iterations occur.

10. **Decision Log Discipline:** All design decisions should continue to be documented in [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md:1) with clear rationale and stakeholder approval where required.
