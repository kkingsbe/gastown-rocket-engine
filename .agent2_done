## Design Decisions Logged

All design decisions have been logged in DECISIONS.md:

- DEC-002: Chamber Temperature Selection
- DEC-003: Feed Pressure Selection
- DEC-004: Margin Limitation on REQ-001
- DEC-005: Design Isp for Propellant Budget
- DEC-006: Preheat Time vs. Power Constraint Trade-off
- DEC-007: Molybdenum Material Selection for Chamber and Nozzle
- DEC-008: Wall Thickness Determination (Manufacturability-Limited)
- DEC-009: Envelope Length Constraint Exception
- DEC-010: Mounting Flange Material Selection
- DEC-011: VER-001 Finding Disposition - Isp Discrepancy Acceptance (by Agent 1)
- DEC-012: VER-002 Finding Disposition - Conservative Margin Acceptance (by Agent 1)
- DEC-013: Thrust Range Limitation Due to Feed Pressure Constraint
- DEC-014: Feed System Material Selection
- DEC-015: Feed Line Diameter Selection
- DEC-016: Thermal Insulation Selection
- DEC-017: Propellant Initial Temperature Specification

## Known Issues/Constraints

1. **Envelope Length Constraint (REQ-012):** The overall thruster length (209.1 mm) exceeds 150 mm requirement by 59.1 mm. This constraint exception is documented in DEC-009. Resolution options include:
   - Bell nozzle optimization (reduces length to 183.5 mm, still exceeds requirement)
   - Reduce expansion ratio (Isp margin reduces from 86.4% to 50.0%)
   - Relax envelope to 210 mm

2. **Thrust Range Limitation (REQ-003):** Achievable thrust range is 0.8-1.0 N within feed pressure constraints (0.15-0.30 MPa). The 1.2 N upper bound requires 0.36 MPa feed pressure, which exceeds the 0.30 MPa limit from REQ-009. This is documented in DEC-013.
