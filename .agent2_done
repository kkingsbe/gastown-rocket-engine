   - Script: design/scripts/catalyst_preheat_thermal.py
   - Data: design/data/catalyst_preheat_thermal.json
   - Plot: design/plots/DES003_preheat_curve.png

## Design Decisions Logged

All design decisions have been logged in DECISIONS.md:
- DEC-001: Nozzle Efficiency Selection
- DEC-002: Chamber Temperature Selection
- DEC-003: Feed Pressure Selection
- DEC-004: Margin Limitation on REQ-001
- DEC-005: Design Isp for Propellant Budget
- DEC-006: Preheat Time vs. Power Constraint Trade-off
- DEC-007: Molybdenum Material Selection for Chamber and Nozzle
- DEC-008: Wall Thickness Determination (Manufacturability-Limited)
- DEC-009: Envelope Length Constraint Exception
- DEC-010: Mounting Flange Material Selection

## Known Issues/Constraints

1. **Envelope Length Constraint (REQ-012):** The overall thruster length (209.1 mm) exceeds the 150 mm requirement by 59.1 mm. This constraint exception is documented in DEC-009. Resolution options include:
   - Bell nozzle optimization (reduces length to 183.5 mm, still exceeds requirement)
   - Reduce expansion ratio (Isp margin reduces from 86.4% to 50.0%)
   - Relax envelope to 210 mm
